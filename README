The application demonstrates an issue with dependency resolution when a dependency is published to maven,
using the maven-publish plugin, with multiple publications.

**Please note, this is not an issue with composite projects.**

To demo:

 - from _libb_ directory run `gradle publishToMavenLocal`
 - from _liba_ directory run `gradle publishToMavenLocal`
 - from _app_ directory run `gradle dependencies`

Result:

 - all configurations fail to show transitive dependencies of `org.example:liba:0.1-SNAPSHOT`

To fix:

 - in _liba/build.gradle_ comment out `publication` `someDocs`
